	abstract   = {The increasing functional and nonfunctional requirements of real-time applications, the advent of mixed criticality computing, and the necessity of reducing costs are leading to an increase in the interest for employing COTS hardware in real-time domains. In this scenario, the Linux kernel is emerging as a valuable solution on the software side, thanks to the rich support for hardware devices and peripherals, along with a well-established programming environment. However, Linux has been developed as a general-purpose operating system, followed by several approaches to introduce actual real-time capabilities in the kernel. Among these, the PREEMPT_RT patch, developed by the kernel maintainers, has the goal to increase the predictability and reduce the latencies of the kernel directly modifying the existent kernel code. This article aims at providing a survey of the state-of-the-art approaches for building real-time Linux-based systems, with a focus on PREEMPT_RT, its evolution, and the challenges that should be addressed in order to move PREEMPT_RT one step ahead. Finally, we present some applications and use cases that have already benefited from the introduction of this patch.},

    abstract = {ROS, an open-source robot operating system, is widely used and rapidly developed in the robotics community. However, running on Linux, ROS does not provide real-time guarantees, while real-time tasks are required in many robot applications such as robot motion control. This paper for the first time presents a real-time ROS architecture called RT-RTOS on multi-core processors. RT-ROS provides an integrated real-time/non-real-time task execution environment so real-time and non-real-time ROS nodes can be separately run on a real-time OS and Linux, respectively, with different processor cores. In such a way, real-time tasks can be supported by real-time ROS nodes on a real-time OS, while non-real-time ROS nodes on Linux can provide other functions of ROS. Furthermore, high performance is achieved by executing real-time ROS nodes and non-real-time ROS nodes on different processor cores. We have implemented RT-ROS on a dual-core processor and conducted various experiments with real robot applications. The experimental results show that RT-ROS can effectively provide real-time support for the ROS platform with high performance by exploring the multi-core architecture.}

A number of variants of the H-CBS algorithm have been proposed in the last years, but all of them have been conceived for implicit server deadlines (i.e., equal to the server period). However, recent promising results on semi-partitioned scheduling together with the demand for new functionality claimed by the Linux community, urge the need for a reservation algorithm that is able to work with constrained deadlines. This paper presents three novel H-CBS algorithms that support constrained deadlines. The three algorithms are formally analyzed, and their performance are compared through an extensive set of simulations.},
